The TAMC directory contains the three examples (heatb, heatilub, and webb)
that were originally designed to use the TAMC automatic differentiaion 
engine. The Makefile (Makefile.TAMC) can be used on either Cywin or Linux. 
All of the files that are meant to be generated by TAMC are distributed with 
the .sav extension. To run the code without TAMC installed, copy the .sav 
files to filenames with only the .f extension.
